	<h1>Hello, World!</h1>

	<!-- p means paragraph -->
	<p>I am an undergraduate student in the Cognitive Science and Visual Arts departments at the University of California, San Diego.</p>

	<p>After working on some really awesome technologies in <a href="search.html">Search</a> I decided to get back to one of my passions... movie making.</p>

	<p>I was still just 25 years old and I wanted to work in an industry that had been around for longer than a few years. Feature film production had always interested me and when I was a student at UCSD I took classes in the Visual Arts department, mostly movie making classes.</p>

	<p>At that time, in 1999 digital video cameras had just come out. Students were still shooting with video tapes. As soon as Canon came out with the first digital cameras we could see that everything was going to change. Shooting would change. Editing would change. Movie theaters would change... Everything.</p>

	<p>So I started working as a crew member, nothing special, just a Grip or an Electrician or a Camera Assistant. I did anything that allowed me to learn how to work on set. It was a wonderful experience.</p>

	<p>After a while I decided to create a company. We built all of the equipment that is used to make movies, commercials, music videos... and we built great big trucks to haul the gear around. Movie production companies would hire me and my crew to shoot their movies and TV shows. It was a lot of fun.</p>

	<p>My <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1839061/" target="_new">movie credits</a> started to pile up and I enjoyed success in an industry that I had always wanted to excell in.</p>

	<p>My crew got so big that I had to create a social network to keep everyone in touch with each other. Soon other crew members started to join. Then all of a sudden there were a thousand crew members.</p>

	<p>All the movie stories are too many to tell on this little webpage, but it was a very fun time.</p>
