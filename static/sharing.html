	<h1>Hello, World!</h1>

	<!-- p means paragraph -->
	<p>I am an undergraduate student in the Cognitive Science and Visual Arts departments at the University of California, San Diego.</p>

	</ol>

	<p>When the "Drop Box" style file sharing started to become popular, I went to work at a company that had been in the business of Enterprise file management and synchronization.</p>

	<p>Big companies and government agencies that maintain databases of sensitive information need to manage their information in secure ways. Employees may need to look up patient records. Customers may need to view transaction histories. People may need to access protected information from mobile devices. Sometimes they want to use laptops or desktop computers with web browsers. There are a lot of different ways that organizations share protected information.</p>

	<p>So... I helped to build some applications that do this kind of thing. Access privileges, encryption, networking protocol, auditing, legal stuff, HIPAA compliance...</p>

	<p>Sharing can be complicated.</p>

	<p>On the topic of sharing, I'm a fan of <a href="https://github.com/bwtk" target="_new">Github</a>.</p>
